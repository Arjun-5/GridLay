# GridLay

A small physics-based puzzle project where:

- Tiles are generated procedurally at runtime.
- Obstacles can be dragged using touch or mouse input.
- Obstacles move with physics and respect collision with other objects.
- On drag end, obstacles snap neatly to the nearest quadrant on the tile grid.

## Features
- Procedural tile grid generation
- Smooth physics-based obstacle movement
- Precise snapping to grid on drag release
